# ConsumerDLCybersecurity
A relatively basic deep learning based network activity analyzer intended for consumer use in semi-real time.

It utilizes the KDD CUP '99 dataset to simulate network traffic and uses simple pytorch-based deep learning programs to identify malicious activity.

The KDD CUP '99 dataset or a similarly formatted set from a personal network or live feed would need to be acquired for this program to function.

TQDM progress bars are utilized but can be easily removed if those packages have not been installed.
